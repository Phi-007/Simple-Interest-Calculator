# Simple Interest Calculator 💰

Welcome to the **Simple Interest Calculator**! This is a sleek, user-friendly web application that helps you calculate simple interest on your investments or loans. It could be used as a demo or a tutorial for beginners, this tool makes it easy and fun to learn. 🚀

## 🌟 What is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is the interest calculated on the principal amount only. It's straightforward and doesn't compound over time. Perfect for short-term loans or basic savings calculations.

### The Magic Formula 📐

The core formula used in this calculator is:

**Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**

Where:
- **Principal**: The initial amount of money (e.g., $1000)
- **Rate**: The annual interest rate as a percentage (e.g., 5%)
- **Time**: The number of years the money is invested or borrowed (e.g., 2 years)

Then, the **Total Amount** you receive is:

**Total Amount = Principal + Interest**

### Example Calculation 🧮

Let's say you deposit **$1000** at a **5%** interest rate for **2 years**:

- Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = **$100**
- Total Amount = 1000 + 100 = **$1100**

In the year **2026** (assuming current year is 2024), you'll have $1100!
